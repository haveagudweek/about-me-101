      Hi, the name is Yasir. An undergraduate computer science student in IPB
      University, Indonesia. Born and raised in Bogor, yet doesn't know the city
      completely. He has an addiction in cinema (the so-called "cinephile"). His
      3 favorite movies of all time (can change): <em>Arrival</em> (2016) by
      Denis Villeneuve, <em>Murder on the Orient Express</em> (2017) by Sir
      Kenneth Branagh, and Daniel Craig's <em>007</em> franchise.
